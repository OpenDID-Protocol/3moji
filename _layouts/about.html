            <h4>What is 3moji?</h4>
            <p>
                3moji is a home for 3D Emoji. The website is a current work in progress as is the 3moji set, but it's slowly getting better every day.
                You can see the progress Iâ€™ve made so far by heading over to the <a class="textlink"
                href="Smileys&Emotion.html">categories</a> page or search for a specific Emoji on the <a class="textlink"
                href="search.html">search</a> page. If you what more info, or are interested in the project? <a class="textlink" href="mailto:info@3moji.org">Reach out!</a>

            </p>

            <h4>3moji Usage ðŸ’…</h4>
            <br>
            <h2>ðŸŽ¨ NonCommercial Use:</h2>
            <p>The emoji are licensed under <a class="textlink" rel="license"
                    href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC-BY-NC</a>. Feel free to use them
                without asking for any NonCommercial
                projects! When you credit the work please include 3moji.org to link back to the project. If youâ€™re using
                the 3D files then most likely Iâ€™ve hidden a little 3moji.org logo in the mesh so that should cover it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>ðŸ’¸ Commercial Use:</h2>
            <p>I decided to license 3moji under <a class="textlink" rel="license"
                    href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC-BY-NC</a> for now.
                Generally I want people to use the emoji though, so if you have a cool use case that is commercial
                please drop me an email. Chances are Iâ€™m on board with what you want to make! I might ask you to support
                the project for the duration of use but only if you are capable of doing so.</p>
