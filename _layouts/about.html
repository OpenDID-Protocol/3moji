            <h4>What is 3moji?</h4>
            <p>
                3moji is my attempt at creating a 3D Emoji library. The website is a current work in progress as are the
                Emoji themselves, but they are both slowly getting better day by day.

                You can see the progress Iâ€™ve made so far by heading over to the <a class="textlink"
                    href="index.html">home page</a> or search for a
                specific Emoji on the <a class="textlink" href="search.html">search page</a>. If you want more info, or are
                interested in the project then <a class="textlink" href="mailto:info@3moji.org">contact me here!</a> Something to note. 
                This project is not directly associated with any NFT project. I've seen some projects pop up with the 3moji name.
