            <h4>3moji Developer Package</h4>
    
            <p>You can download the developer package on github. Currently it includes, gltf, glb, fbx, png images, and a
                csv file with mapped names and unicode characters.</p>

            <p> If you do start to use 3moji in a project you should know that there could definitely be some small errors like flipped
                normals or incorrect scaling. If you find something let me know at <a class="textlink"
                    href="mailto:info@3moji.org">info@3moji.org</a>!
                It Helps me make the library better. </p>
                
            <p>Also love to see what you're building, so feel free to share your project! ðŸ˜„</p>
