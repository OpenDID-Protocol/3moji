                without asking for any NonCommercial
                projects! When you credit the work please include 3moji.org to link back to the project. If youâ€™re using
                the 3D files then most likely Iâ€™ve hidden a little 3moji.org logo in the mesh so that should cover it.

            <h2>ðŸ’¸ Commercial Use:</h2>
            <p>I decided to license 3moji under <a class="textlink" rel="license"
                    href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC-BY-NC</a> for now.
                Generally I want people to use the emoji though, so if you have a cool use case please drop me an email.
                Chances are Iâ€™m on board with what you want to make! At this point I might ask you to support the
                project for the duration of use but only if you are capable of doing so.</p>
